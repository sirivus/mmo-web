    Code transpilation issues

If you are using a JavaScript transpiler like babel or TypeScript, calling evaluate() with an async function might not work. This is because while playwright uses Function.prototype.toString() to serialize functions while transpilers could be changing the output code in such a way it's incompatible with playwright.

Some workarounds to this problem would be to instruct the transpiler not to mess up with the code, for example, configure TypeScript to use latest ECMAScript version ("target": "es2018"). Another workaround could be using string templates instead of functions:

  await page.evaluate(`(async() => {
  console.log('1');
  })()`);

  error reason:
  I was using this component within a react.js application. Since react.js is rendered in the browser, it makes sense that there is no node.js version information.
  need implement node.js runtime in browser.
