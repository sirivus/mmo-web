PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 playwright install chromium
pyinstaller -F main.py
build python 'main.spec' without file extension name.

>>> from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
>>> playwright = sync_playwright().start()

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
playwright = sync_playwright().start()

# Use playwright.chromium, playwright.firefox or playwright.webkit
# Pass headless=False to launch() to see the browser UI
>>> browser = playwright.chromium.launch()
>>> page = browser.new_page()
>>> page.goto("http://whatsmyuseragent.org/")
>>> page.screenshot(path="example.png")
>>> browser.close()
>>> playwright.stop()

note

Bundling the browsers with the executables will generate bigger binaries. It is recommended to only bundle the browsers you use.

main-py % sudo -H python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
-H is global command.

mistyped package install playright, need playwright
# Run from your project's root directory
npm init playwright@latest
# Or create a new project
npm init playwright@latest new-project

This will create a configuration file, optionally add examples, a GitHub Action workflow and a first test example.spec.ts. You can now jump directly to writing assertions section.
Manually

Add dependency and install browsers.

npm i -D @playwright/test
# install supported browsers
npx playwright install
