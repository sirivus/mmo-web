error : src/text.d.ts:3:34 - error TS1183: An implementation cannot be declared in ambient contexts.

These two things combined together are the problem:

    I made a index.d.ts file

    I am trying to assign a function to String.prototype.

A d.ts file is a TypeScript declaration file. These files only declare types and cannot contain implementation code hence your two errors:

    Statements are not allowed in ambient contexts.

    An implementation cannot be declared in ambient contexts.

Implementation code is code that is not a type annotation or an alternative way of describing this is implementation code is code that is executed during runtime.

You probably aren't intending to write a declaration file â€“ they are often only used to add types to libraries which aren't written in TypeScript. As a result you should rename your file from index.d.ts to index.ts.
