  <para>Because Npcap is a packet capture architecture, not merely a software
    library, some aspects of installation and configuration may fall to the end
    user. This Users' Guide covers the basics of installing, configuring, and
    removing Npcap, as well as how to report bugs.</para>

    <para>
      Npcap is distributed as a signed executable installer, downloadable from
      <ulink url="https://nmap.org/npcap/#download">Nmap.com</ulink>. Major
      versions are backwards-compatible, and users of the free non-commercial
      version are encouraged to upgrade regularly for security and stability
      fixes. Software distributors may have separate requirements for supported
      Npcap versions.  Please refer to
      <ulink url="http://www.npcap.org/#License">the Npcap License</ulink> for
      terms of use and redistribution.</para>

    <title>How to use Wireshark to capture raw 802.11 traffic in <quote>Monitor Mode</quote></title>

    <para>
      The latest Wireshark has already integrated the support for Npcap's <quote>Monitor Mode</quote> capture.
      If you want to use Wireshark to capture raw 802.11 traffic in <quote>Monitor Mode</quote>, you need to
      switch on the monitor mode inside the Wireshark UI instead of using <xref linkend="npcap-feature-dot11-wlanhelper" />.
      This is because Wireshark only recognizes the monitor mode set by itself. So when you turn
      on monitor mode outside Wireshark (like in <filename>WlanHelper</filename>), Wireshark will not know the adapter
      has been in monitor mode, and will still try to capture in Ethernet mode, which will get no traffic.

	    As Microsoft states <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2019184">here</ulink>,
          <emphasis>an optional NDIS light-weight filter (LWF) driver like Npcap could cause
            90-second delay in network availability</emphasis>. Some solutions you could try
          are: 1) wait for 90 seconds; 2) disable and re-enable the adapter icon in
          <command>ncpa.cpl</command>; 3) reboot. If the network is still unable to connect,
          please <ulink role="hidepdf" url="http://issues.npcap.org/new?title=Npcap+Bug+Report">file a bug report</ulink>.

          Such adapters won't show up in Wireshark if the <varname>Basic Filtering Enging (BFE)</varname>

      <listitem><para>Npcap only captures TCP handshake and teardown, but not data packets.
          Some network adapters support offloading of tasks to free up CPU time for
          performance reasons. When this happens, Npcap may not receive all of the
          packets, or may receive them in a different form than is actually sent on the
          wire. To avoid this issue, you may disable TCP Chimney, IP Checksum
          Offloading, and Large Send Offloading in the network adapter properites on
          Windows. See details about this issue in

      In your report, please provide your <emphasis>DiagReport</emphasis> output, user
      software version (e.g. Nmap, Wireshark), steps to reproduce the problem, and other information
      you think necessary. If your issue occurs only on a particular OS version (e.g. Win10

      <title>Diagnostic report</title>

      <para>
        Npcap has provided a diagnostic utility called <filename>DiagReport</filename>.
        It provides a lot of information including OS metadata, Npcap related files,
        install options, registry values, services, etc. You can simply click the
        <filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\DiagReport.bat</filename> file to run <filename>DiagReport</filename>.
        It will pop up a text report via Notepad (it's stored in: <filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\DiagReport.txt</filename>).
        Please always submit it to us if you encounter any issues.

        <filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\NPFInstall.log</filename>, please submit

      <para>
        For problems with Npcap's regular operation, you may need to obtain a
        debug log from <filename>Packet.dll</filename>.  To do this, you will
        need a debug build of Npcap.  If you are a Npcap developer, you can build
        the <filename>Packet.sln</filename> project with the
        <varname>_DEBUG_TO_FILE</varname> macro defined. If you are an end user,
        you can contact the Npcap development team for the latest Npcap debug
        build.  The debugging process will continue to append to the debug log
        (<filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\Packet.log</filename>), so you may want
        to delete it after an amount of time, or save your output to another
        place before it gets too large.

      <title>Driver log</title>

      <para>
        If there is an issue with the Npcap driver, you can open an
        <emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> command prompt,  enter <command>sc query
          npcap</command> to query the driver status and <command>net start
          npcap</command> to start the driver (replace
        <replaceable>npcap</replaceable> with <replaceable>npf</replaceable> if you
        installed Npcap in <quote>WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote>).  The command
        output will inform you whether there's an error. If the driver is running
        well, but the issue still exists, then you may need to check the driver's
        log. Normal Npcap releases don't switch on the driver log function for
        performance. Contact the Npcap development team to obtain a driver-debug
        version of the Npcap installer.  When you have got an appropriate
        driver-debug version Npcap, you need to use <ulink role="hidepdf"
          url="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/debugview.aspx">DbgView</ulink>
        to read the Windows kernel log (which contains our driver log).  You may
        need to turn on DbgView before installing Npcap, if the error occurs when
        the driver loads. When done, save the DbgView output to a file and submit
        it in your report.
