Lost in CYBERSPACE
====================

**Lost in CYBERSPACE** is a cooperative game designed for 2 players, each playing on a separate device.
The only connection you need between each other is your voice.
You can be in the same room or on the other part of the world, as long as you can hear each other.

One player takes a role of a **HACKER** lost in the **CYBERSPACE** maze of a corporate network. They need to move around **CYBERSPACE**, read the access codes to **NAVIGATOR** and find the **TARGET** node to hack it. But beware! Hacking wrong nodes will make you easier to locate and you will be lost in **CYBERSPACE** when the time runs out!

The other player takes a role of a **NAVIGATOR** who uses a terminal to decode the access codes they got from **HACKER**, read the map of **CYBERSPACE** and help **HACKER** find the way to the **TARGET** node.

This game is made for the [js13kgames 2017](http://2017.js13kgames.com/) competition.
